App should display a simple layout with roundnet player names. To this list you can either add to or remove from. 

onClick you should go to the player page displaying a number of stats with a radar chart visualizing these stats.

## Plan:

Basic page, initially listing all player names with a search bar to filter for a specific player. 
  - render out player names
  - Search Bar with filter function to only render specific player(s)
  - (to be added IF database grows larger and includes different communites): ability to sort players? 

Render player page when player name is clicked: 
 - name: ,
 - serving: ,
 - serveReceiving: ,
 - setting: ,
 - hitting: ,
 - defense: {
  - short: ,
  - long
  },
 - strengths: ,
 - weaknesses: ,
 - notablePartners: ,

 - Users should be able to add notes which can be opened in a modal. These notes can be edited and saved.
